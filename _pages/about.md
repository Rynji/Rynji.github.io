## Hi there! 

I'm Timon Nap, 30 years old and from The Netherlands, Utrecht area. 

My professional work has consisted mostly of working as a game programmer. I have worked on two entertainment games: [New Heights](/project/new-heights) & [Infinity Skies](/project/infinity-skies) both at [Wikkl](https://www.wikkl.me) and one big serious game project which is the [custom interactive floor platform](/project/interactive-floor-project) at [Springlab](https://springlab.nl). These projects have been developed in small teams (5-20 people) and besides game programming I have done a lot of UI implementation/design and some level design.

Gaming has been my #1 interest since a young age; I remember back during the PSone days I kept judging games' graphics by how good looking the trees were. My first development work started when I got into texture and modeling mods. At the age of 14 I spent countless hours modelling in 3ds max.
Programming sparked my interest during my computer science bachelor which I completed at the Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences in 2017.

During my bachelor years I have also studied in Trondheim, Norway for a semester in 2016; At the Norwegian University of Science and Technology. At the NTNU I worked on a VR project using Unreal Engine. I absolutely loved my time in Norway and ever since I try to regularly travel to interesting places. Some of the places I've been to are Ukraine (2018), Kazakhstan and Armenia.

I'm also an avid weightlifter, which has become a big hobby and drives me to improve myself every single day.
