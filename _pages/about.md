## Hi there! 

I’m Timon Nap — a 32-year-old Unity/C# developer based in the Utrecht area (NL), with over 7 years of experience in building interactive 3D applications, serious games, and simulation-driven tools.

Most of my work revolves around gameplay systems, UI implementation, and making prototypes production-ready. I’ve worked on projects ranging from entertainment games like [New Heights](/project/new-heights) and [Infinity Skies](/project/infinity-skies), to serious applications like [Springlab’s interactive floor platform](/project/interactive-floor-project) and various [Training Tools](/project/innovam) for the automotive industry.

I enjoy building clean, modular systems that are flexible enough to scale — especially when working with real-world constraints and existing codebases. My background in computer science (BSc AUAS, 2017) and my time abroad in Norway (NTNU, 2016) gave me a solid foundation in both technical and creative collaboration.

Outside of work, I’m into weightlifting, I occassionaly take out my bicycle, and I enjoy tinkering with tech — including working on my own Yaris GRMN, which I maintain and upgrade for both fun and function. I also enjoy traveling, especially to lesser-known destinations which have included Armenia (2023), Kazakhstan (2019), and Ukraine (2018).
