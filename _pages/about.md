## Hi there! 

I'm Timon Nap, 26 years old and from The Netherlands, Utrecht area. 

My professional work for the past 2.5 years as game programmer has been in developing serious games for a custom interactive floor platform at Springlab. With a team of 6-8 people we are working closely together during all stages of development. We're releasing multiple games per year for the interactive floor platform. 

During my bachelor years I have also studied in Trondheim, Norway for a semester . I absolutely loved it over there and ever since I try to regularly travel to interesting places. Some of the places I've been to are Ukraine and Kazakhstan; The header picture of me has actually been taken at Big Almaty Lake in Kazakhstan.

I've been interested in gaming since a young age; I remember during the PSone days, when I was very young, I kept judging games' graphics by how good looking the trees were. My first development work started when I got into texture and modeling mods.
When I really got into programming was during my computer science (game development) bachelor which I completed at the Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences in 2017.

I love working together with other professionals on creating creative solutions to design problems; getting systems running and iterating on implementations to get that perfect feel to it in the end.
