Getting this portfolio online was a _bit_ more work than I thought it would be. I had figured it would take me a day or two after learning the ropes with Jekyll; but I needed more than a week of work after getting the actual theme running on github pages.  

It was a lot of fun working with this setup of Jekyll and Github pages though, I must say. I had a local instance of the page running so any changes I made to the project in VSCode could be previewed within seconds.

I can now use this webpage as my personal showcase which I'll keep updating and working on.

This is it for my first post; I just wanted some content to be here so the blog page wasn't empty or filled with a demo page :-)
