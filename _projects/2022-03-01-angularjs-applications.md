During my time at Wikkl I have worked on several web and mobile applications (deployed on both iOS & Android) using AngularJS as the base framework.
I was also responsible for creating the current design of the [Wikkl website](https://wikkl.me/en/) which was done using Angular and Tailwind CSS.

The most technically advanced app was the Straight Fire NFT App (see video above) made using Angular in combination with [Ionic](https://ionicframework.com/) and [BabylonJS](https://www.babylonjs.com/).
Users of the NFT App can connect their blockchain wallets and generate videos of their NFTs displayed in a 3D environment.
Most of my work consisted of creating the workflow of loading and rendering the 3D scenes in BabylonJS. I devised a workflow in Blender to setup the scenes which were then imported in the web app using .gltf format.
I also created a big portion of the apps pages using Angular and Ionic.

A [New Heights](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2179440/New_Heights_Realistic_Climbing_and_Bouldering/) related project I have also worked on was a website leaderboard page for the game. This page allows everyone to see the leaderboards of New Heights without having to launch the game or even be at a computer.
The leaderboards page was made using AngularJS and Tailwind CSS and it can be viewed [here](https://newheightsgame.com/leaderboards/-/-/-)

My first real venture into app development was the development of the ANNA App. I was responsible for implementing all the pages inside the app. This app revolves around a chatbot (ANNA) which gives you advice based on a brainscan. The chatbot can also give you articles related to you. These are saved in the app and all data related to you can be seen in the app.
