At [Innovam](https://www.innovam.nl/over-innovam), I work as a Unity Developer on advanced 3D, AR & VR applications within the automotive domain — including interactive EV training systems, real-time AR product visualizations, and scalable simulation frameworks. I contribute across architecture, content implementation, and system design. On this page you can read more about the work I am currently doing at Innovam.


## EV Trainer - Multiplatform Interactive Training Solution

EV Trainer is an interactive training application built entirely in Unity C#, designed to teach users the legally required safety procedures for working on high-voltage electric vehicles (EVs). The application offers hands-on interaction with tools and car components, enabling users to practice and understand real-world safety protocols in a safe digital environment.

A fully narrated and animated introductory chapter walks users through the fundamentals of high-voltage systems in modern EVs. This chapter serves both as theoretical background and as an accessible entry point for new users.

The app is built using a modular, step-based architecture, allowing new training modules to be created with minimal overhead by reusing core interaction logic. I implemented full localisation support using Unity's Localisation package, making the app accessible to a wider audience.

EV Trainer runs seamlessly on both desktop and mobile platforms, and I also developed a standalone controller-based version of the HV explanation chapters, optimized for kiosk setups or exhibition use.


## F1 VR Pitstop Game - Multiplayer VR Entertainment Experience

Originally conceived as an internal demo, F1 VR Pitstop evolved into a fully playable multiplayer VR game, offering a high-energy experience where four players work together in VR to perform as many F1 pitstops as possible within a five-minute time limit.

Players are connected via Netcode for GameObjects (NGO) and use Oculus Quest headsets, physically moving around in a shared space to avoid motion sickness and increase immersion. Team coordination is essential, with each player responsible for a specific task in the pit crew.

While the core networking setup and foundational architecture were developed by my colleague [Glenn Comis](https://www.linkedin.com/in/glenn-comis/), I provided crucial Unity development support and contributed to approximately 30% of the overall implementation, including gameplay logic and design feedback. I also assisted in refining interaction flow and ensuring smooth performance across sessions.

The multiplayer sessions are currently hosted manually via a VPS, giving the team direct control over session stability and deployment.


## Virtual Cities - Multiplayer Urban Simulation

Virtual Cities is an interactive multiplayer environment currently being developed with the Municipality of Groningen. The application loads the real-world city using geospatial data, allowing users to explore the environment and enter dedicated sub-projects where advanced scenarios — such as live bicycle traffic simulations — take place.

The project runs on a dedicated VPS server and uses Netcode for GameObjects for seamless multiplayer networking.


##### My contributions to this project include:

* **Real-time map integration** <br>
I implemented an in-game interactive map and minimap using the OnlineMaps Unity package, synchronized across the network. The map reflects the real geography of Groningen and displays the live positions of other players.
* **Full avatar customization** <br>
Players can customize their characters through ReadyPlayerMe integration. In addition, I’m currently developing a fully in-house avatar creator with my artist colleagues to provide greater control over avatar design and styling.
* **Bicycle traffic intensity visualization** <br>
I built a 3D data visualization system that shows admin configurable bicycle flow per cycling path, displaying how many cyclists pass through a given area each hour. The visualization is synchronized for all connected players, providing a consistent and shared data experience. This way residents can get a feel for what a certain amount of cyclist per hour through their neighbourhood or street looks like.

## MR Vehicle Showcase – Augmented Reality Car Experience

This augmented reality application was developed for a major automotive client and allows users to explore the latest car models in full 3D through AR. Each vehicle features **custom interactive hotspots**, complete with **fully animated sequences** and **voiceovers** that highlight key features and selling points.

The app is built in Unity on top of a **large and complex legacy codebase**, which brings both technical constraints and integration challenges. While deep refactoring isn’t always possible, I’ve become highly proficient at **working within existing architecture** to implement new functionality and content in a clean and stable way.

My role primarily focused on developing **animation-driven content** and **visual storytelling elements**, ensuring that each vehicle is presented smoothly, clearly, and in line with brand guidelines.

This project strengthened my ability to navigate **non-ideal codebases**, deliver under architectural constraints, and still maintain a high standard of quality and consistency — a key asset in production-heavy environments.
